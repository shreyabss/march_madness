****March Madness - Win Prediction****

**Introduction**

March Madness refers to the NCAA college basketball tournament, a single-elimination tournament featuring 68 teams competing to be crowned the national champions. Our project aims to predict the outcome of the 2023 March Madness bracket using machine learning models trained on historical data from 1985 to 2022.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes regular season and tournament game statistics for college basketball teams. We performed various preprocessing and exploratory data analysis techniques, including agglomerative clustering and dimensionality reduction, to understand and prepare the data for modeling.

**Models**

We implemented and evaluated several classification and regression models, including:
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
XG Boost
Neural network
Each model was carefully tuned using hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best performance.


**Results**

Our best-performing model was KNN. This demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting the outcomes of complex sporting events like March Madness.
